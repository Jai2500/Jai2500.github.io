Hello ðŸ‘‹ !

My name is Jai. I work as a pre-doctoral researcher at TCS Research where I work with [Ramya Hebbalaguppe](https://rhebbalaguppe.github.io/) in the Deep Learning and AI Lab. At TCS my work predominantly revolves around generative models such as diffusion models (such as their evaluation, controllability and interpretability) and 3D computer graphics (viz. curve skeletonizations, DDG).

Prior to joining TCS Research, I completed my Masters Thesis under [Dr. Subhadip Mitra](https://sites.google.com/site/subhadipmitra/) in CCNSB IIIT Hyderabad on the topic of ["Revisiting Deep Learning for Particle Physics"](https://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/view_publication/mastersthesis/1269). I currently work part-time as a research lead â€” guiding projects related to self-supervised representation learning for foundation models, GNN interpretability and generative modelling.

I am open to discussing interesting ideas in any of these domains. So hit me up if you'd like to collaborate!

You can get my updated CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xk3wYx-_JzehZe1O56wq5qxsd2hayotX/view?usp=sharing).
